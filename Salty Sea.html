            There were 2 brothers named Ramu and Shamu.Shamu was rich and Ramu was poor.one day Rumu decided to ask Shamu some money but Shamu refused to give.Rumu was was going to his house,by the way he saw an old man.the old man asked why are you sad?Ramu told i am very poor.The old man said if you help me by carrying this wood to my house then i will make you rich.Ramu helped the old man by carrying the woods.The old man gave Rumu a gold plate and told go to the jungle and there will be a rock next to that there will be a cave.There will be 3 dwarfs go and give the gold plate to them.They will want the gold plate and in return bring the treadmill.Ramu did as the old man said.One of the dwarfs said you can wish whatever you want but if you want to stop it put a red cloth on the treadmill.Ramu went to his house and asked food and when it was enough he covered it with red cloth.If there was more food then he would sell it.By the treadmill Ramu became richer than Shamu.One day Shamu hid and saw he was jealous of Ramu so he planned to steal the treadmill.Once he stole he and his family went in the boat because Ramu would find the treadmill.In the food they ate there was no salt so Shamu asked salt.Shamu did not know how to stop the treadmill so the ship sank with Shamu's family.So it is belived that still the salt is coming out of the treadmill.
