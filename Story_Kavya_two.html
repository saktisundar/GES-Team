    <h4>
        Once upon a time, there lived two merchants, Amit
and Dastur, who lived a bit far from each other. But
they didn’t live an honest life. Both of them had
robbed more than fifty houses each. They were big
time crooks in disguise in the kingdom of Roya. <br/>

One day Amit decided to rob the house of Dastur, a
man whom he heard to be rich. At midnight Amit crept
inside Dastur’s house wearing an orange scarf around
his mouth, hoping it would make him look
unrecognisable.<br/>

He managed to get in the house and stole some
valuables like ruby earrings, silver plates, Dastur’s
wife’s precious silk gowns and more. But when Amit
was about to get out, Dastur got up to drink water and
saw the shadow of Amit.<br/>

“Stop thief. Stop!” he shouted.<br/>

Dastur tried to catch him but Amit was too fast. Dastur
was unhappy. He couldn’t even see who the thief was.
He only caught a glimpse of the orange scarf he wore.
But there was worse news for Dastur. It was his sister’s
wedding tomorrow and the thief stole all the gifts for
his sister. <br/>

So, he decided to do what he did best, steal. Dastur
covered himself with a black shawl and trotted along
the street, when he saw a mansion.<br/>

“Aha! The owner of this mansion must be rich. I shall
rob this house now,” he said and climbed the gate.<br/>

Little did he know that this was the house of Amit!<br/>

Dastur crept stealthily into the mansion and stole
some valuables like golden bangles, copper vases
decorated with semi-precious stones, Amit’s son’s
leopard fur hat and more. But Dastur also found
something familiar, <br/>

“Isn’t this the silk gown I gifted to my wife on her
birthday? “he thought out loud.<br/>

Before he could realize anything, he heard a voice.<br/>

“Thief! Thief! Stop! Stop!<br/>

It was Amit. Amit tried to catch Dastur but failed to.
He didn’t even see how he looked like! Only the black
shawl the thief was wearing was visible to his eye. Amit
decided to let him go, he would rob a house tomorrow
anyway. <br/>

Next day early morning, both Amit and Dastur went to
the park wearing their orange scarf and black shawl!
Since it was early in the morning, not much people
were around.<br/>

Amit and Dastur sat in a bench not saying anything to
each other when Dastur noticed Amit’s scarf looked
familiar. Amir asked Dastur,<br/>

“What are you looking at?” he asked suspiciously. “Oh
nothing” Dastur said.<br/>

“Did you sleep at night; your eyes are so red?” Dastur
said, trying to change the topic.<br/>

“No, I didn’t, Amit laughed. “I was robbed by a thief
wearing a silly black shawl. The thief stole many
valuables including my son’s leopard cap which I
bought in Tibet for a very expensive prize” he boasted.<br/>

Dastur went white with fear. Why it was him who stole
the leopard cap yesterday and it was him who wore a
black shawl and he was still wearing it now! Hastily
hiding the shawl, he told:<br/>

“Well, what a coincidence! Even I got robbed by a thief.
Its just that the thief who stole from me was wearing
an orange scarf and stole very precious ruby earrings!<br/>

It was Amit’s turn to go white with fear this time. He
slowly removed his orange scarf and kept it aside
when…<br/>

Hey! That orange scarf! I Recognise it! The thief wore
it! You are the thief aren’t you!? Dastur shouted.<br/>

In his outburst, the black shawl which had been tucked
beside him fell and this time Amit shouted.<br/>

“You’re one to say! This black shawl belongs to the
thief who stole from my house! That means you are
the thief who stole from me!<br/>

They began fighting. This was all watched by a small
girl and her friends. They walked up to the two men
and told: “Ahem”.<br/>

“What do you want little girl” was the reply.<br/>

“We heard you fighting “continued the girl. “And we
have a solution”.<br/>

“What is it?” asked Dastur.<br/>

“Isn’t it obvious?” said the girl. “If you “she pointed to
Amit. “Give back the other guy what you took from
him, he will do the same to you!”<br/>

The two thieves looked at each other and cried out:
“That’s a brilliant idea”!<br/>

An hour later they did exactly what the little girl
instructed them to do and finally the two silly thieves
got what they wanted!<br/>
