    <h4>
        Amelia woke up with a start. She had a bad
nightmare. After looking around her room a few
times she felt better. But just before Amelia closed
her eyes, she spotted a glowing frisbee. Getting
down from her bed, she grabbed it, not knowing
what she had in wait.<br/><br/>
Amelia blinked and she was no longer in her room.
She looked around. To her amazement she was in
a beach island, which had trampolines and water
slides, surrounded by water with pink baby
dolphins, a bubble machine, coconut trees, an
outdoor barbecue and a sea jet!<br/><br/>
What was more was, the coconut tree didn’t have
coconuts, it had giant Choco bars! Amelia ran
around this strange yet amazing place looking at
its wonders. She paddled in the clear blue sea with
the pink dolphins which were really friendly, rode
on the sea jet, plucked the Choco-bars reaching
them by bouncing on the trampoline, had a great
time in water slides which led to the sea, ate
barbecue and popped bubbles.<br/><br/>
Then all of a sudden, the clouds started rumbling.
Amelia knew it was going to rain so she looked

around for shelter. As though the universe heard
her wish, a large mansion appeared. She quickly
went inside, finding a large galaxy themed
playroom with a jacuzzi. But when she got in the
jacuzzi, Amelia realized that there wasn’t any
pitter-patter sound of the rain.<br/><br/>
She ran out to find it was raining red and blue
jellybeans outside. Amelia couldn’t believe her
eyes and her tongue when she tasted one. After
collecting some in her pocket she spent some more
time on the beach and the waterslides when
suddenly she woke up.<br/><br/>
“Oh well, I should have known it was all a dream”
said Amelia sadly as she looked around her room.
But when she slipped her hands in her pockets
while brushing her teeth, she found the red and
blue jellybeans.
