            I just see myself shining in the charm of the sun.  I feel possessive about me that nobody must take me away except my family.
 This is because once when my grandpa was going down the escalator in a mall, I followed him,
 without letting the rest of the family knowing. I was a bit curious about him going alone then I lost track of him,
 I was so scared then I went near a bin closing my eyes suddenly I hear a sound saying “Raeed where are you” I opened my eyes
 and I saw my whole family near me they found me and cried that’s why I feel possessive about myself in the mirror. 
It doesn't need any change because I don’t want to leave my family who saved me in a crowded area they shine and charm me to 
the sun and that’s why anybody who has a caring family must feel possessive about yourself except you FAMILY!!!!!
