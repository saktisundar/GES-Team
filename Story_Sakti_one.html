        Once there where two thick friends named Ramya and Venu studying in 6th standard. Both their mother’s where online trainers.  One day Venu saw a product which is not for her age but for 23+ year’s people. She was very enthusiastic and started searching many things about that product. She found a payment on delivery website. She ordered the product. Then she got phone call from them to ask the date and time for the delivery. She told the date and time for the delivery when her mother was in class. It was delivered on time. She would use the product only when her mother is in class and hide it after that. Venu told Ramya also to buy it. The same process happened but after telling the date and time she was unwell. And on that day she went to the hospital. After she came home she saw a message as to the product was not able to be delivered and hence it is been cancelled. Meanwhile Venu was unwell in the hospital. After, the doctor said to Venu’s parents that she was unwell because of using the product at this young age, this product must be used only at 23, then doctor also gave treatment and Venu was okay, but after the family went to their house. Her mother asked when and how did you get this? Venu said the whole story, and so her mother said “Go out of the house right now and don’t came back ever in my life.” Ramya hearing Venu’s story, both Ramya and Venu understood that everything has an age in which it should be used.
