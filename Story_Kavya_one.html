    <h1 style="text-align: center;">A GLIMPSE OF PROFESSOR MOUSE’S CLASS</h1>

    <h4>
        Many light years away from earth, on planet Pretzel, Professor Mouse was taking class. Yet his name
        described the opposite of him. <br />

        “He should have been called Professor Dragolion” (the most
        dangerous creature on Pretzel) all the kids say. Professor
        Mouse had always thought that children were bonk heads
        and it was up to him to make sure they come out right.<br />

        Professor Mouse was in a particularly fierce temper today;
        tomorrow there was a math test and Principle Gloopna was
        depending on him to make the class pass.<br />

        “SETTLE DOWN CLASS” he bellowed. The once noisy class
        became quiet. Yet Professor Mouse wasn’t satisfied at all (he
        never was).<br />

        “Marna!!! What did I say about writing your homework in
        glitter pens!? <br />

        Marna was red with embarrassment.<br />

        “I’m sorry Professor “she said in a small voice. I lost my
        normal pens so I thou- <br />

        “That’s no excuse” Professor Mouse growled. “SIMPSON!! Is
        that hair dye?!?! And you BLOOMER! Tuck IN your shirt!
        OLGA! This is a CLASSROOM not GROWLYWOOD (Pretzel’s
        version of Hollywood) so take OFF those ridiculous shoes!
        MORGLOP!?!?!? IS THAT A TATTOO!!?<br />

        After making several complaints and adjustment, Professor
        Mouse finally revised various math formulas that were bound
        to show up in the test. He found that none of the children
        were prepared. This enraged him more for the rest of the
        class, which finished with him screeching: “I EXPECT ALL YOU
        CHILDREN TO STUDY AND HAVE THE FORMULAS ON YOUR
        FINGERTIPS BY TOMORROW!!!!!!!!! LITERALLY!!!! With this
        he slammed the door.<br />

        <center>***********************</center>

        The next day Professor Mouse walked into his class rather
        nervous. To his surprise all his children were as silent as mice
        and none of them were wearing tattoos or high heels or hair
        dye, all of them had tucked in their shirts and no one had
        written their homework in glitter pens (he hoped).<br />

        He smiled at them briefly and began handing out test papers
        when he noticed something wrong. All his pupils had
        scrawled something on their fingers! On their fingertips more
        specifically. <br />

        “Marna will you kindly explain what you and your classmates
        have done to your fingers”?<br />

        “We’ve been doing what you’ve said Professor “said Marna
        earnestly. “We’re having the formulas on our fingertips! Just
        like you said.” <br />

        Professor Mouse slapped his forehead with his hand. He had
        no idea what to do- to hysterically burst into fits of laughs or
        to run frantically run to the principle for help. Professor
        Mouse might have not known what to do, but he now did
        know that children were smart in their own way.<br />

        <center>THE END</center>
